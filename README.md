# <Coding-Quiz>

## Description

A basic coding quiz to test a user's knowledge (and speed!). This project is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
  
Target Audience: Aspiring web developers.

This project will allow users to study some of the basic web development language concepts that they either have already learned, or should learn along with the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript - in a gameified manner.

## Usage

To use the coding quiz:

1. Start the quiz via the "Start Quiz!" Button - which will subsequently start a timer(the user's score).
2. Answer each question as fast as possible in a series of randomly sorted hard-coded questions (If they get a question incorrect, it will detriment their score by 15 seconds).
3. Select the "Save Score!" Button which will redirect you to the highscores page.
4. Input your initials and select "Submit" to submit your initials + score and save them to your local storage.
